# Recommender Systems and Graphs

## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:
* Approaching Recommender Systems with Graph Modeling.

## Reading

PinSage is a recommender system built on node embeddings obtained via
GraphSage. In reading this article, focus on the experimental set-up,
how the graph relates to the recommender systems setup, and how they
evaluate the system (including the discussion of negative sampling!).

* [Pinterest Blog](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/pinsage-a-new-graph-convolutional-neural-network-for-web-scale-recommender-systems-88795a107f48)

This paper uses (heterogeneous) graph modeling to approach
recommendations. Though there are not graph neural networks in this
paper, you should think about how you might use algorithms we've
already studied on the graphs defined in this paper.

## Tasks

* Formulate a recommender problem on Cora and implement a solution
along one of the approaches you read about.

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions:
* Share one proposal idea, with specifics on the graph you are
  defining from the dataset you describing.
