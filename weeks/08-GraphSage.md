# GraphSage

## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:
* Introduction to inductive graph learning via GraphSage

## Reading

* Read an [Intuitive Introduction to
  GraphSage](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-intuitive-explanation-of-graphsage-6df9437ee64f)
* Read the [GraphSage Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216)
* Read through the [PyTorch Reference
  Implementation](https://github.com/williamleif/graphsage-simple)
  created by one of the authors.

## Tasks

* Use the reference implementation for the node classification task on
  the Cora dataset. Use multiple aggregators and parameters. Can you
  take advantage of the inductive nature of the algorithm to do an
  inductive train/test split?

*Note:* you may use other implementations if needed
(e.g. `pytorch_geometric`), however working from this reference
implementation will pay off in the future.

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions:
* Summarize the results of your attempt
* What problems did you have trying to do the task?
